> Oh Noes will try to help you fixing problems with the code, but sometimes he doesn't know what you're trying to do and how to fix it. If there is a problem with a text command, make sure that command has:

* - Commas in the right places, between every argument - check the hint code;
* - Exactly 3 arguments: the message, the x position and the y position.
